Why Go?

    Concurrency
    Performance
    Scalable (Concurrency)
    Compiled

    Simplicity 
        - Only 25 keywords
        - No classes
            - No inheritance
        - Prefer Composition over inheritance
        - No access modifiers
            (access is defined by convention)
        - No Exceptions (only Error)
            To support Concurrency
        - No generics

    Built for Concurrency
        Language features for concurrency
            go, chan, select, range, close
        Builtin Scheduler
        1000s of goroutines can be executed using 1 thread

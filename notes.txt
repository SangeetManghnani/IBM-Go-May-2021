Why Go?

    Concurrency
    Performance
    Scalable (Concurrency)
    Compiled

    Simplicity 
        - Only 25 keywords
        - No classes
            - No inheritance
        - Prefer Composition over inheritance
        - No access modifiers
            (access is defined by convention)
        - No Exceptions (only Error)
            To support Concurrency
        - No generics

    Built for Concurrency
        Language features for concurrency
            go, chan, select, range, close
        Builtin Scheduler
        1000s of goroutines can be executed using 1 thread

    int
    int8
    int16
    int32
    int64

    uint
    uint8
    int16

    int64

    float32
    float64

    complex64 (real float32, imaginary float32)
    complex128 ( real float64, imaginary float64)

    byte (alias for uint8)
    rune (alias for int32, represents 1 unicode character)

strongly typed language
No implicit type conversion


functions
    can return multiple values (tuple)
    supports higher order functions (functions as data)
        can assign a function to a varible
        can pass a function as an argument to another function
        can return a function as a return value from another function
